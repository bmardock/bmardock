TL;DR Work in Progress of helpful projects and playbooks.
## 🔧 Tech Pillars & Playbooks

<details>
<summary>🕵️‍♀️ Research</summary>

- Curate and share influential sources + “cliffnotes” (summary, key takeaways, next steps, follow-up)  
- Spin up backlog tickets for spikes & prototypes to de-risk estimates  
- Follow a due-diligence template when evaluating new tech (maturity, cost, benefits, rollback plan)  
- Store findings in `/playbooks/research-playbook.md` (or your preferred wiki)
</details>

<details>
<summary>🗺️ Plan</summary>

- Evangelize research & optimization tickets into every sprint  
- Buffer for unexpected issues based on past velocity  
- Break down tasks thoroughly: dependencies, blockers, test criteria, unit-test scope  
- Align on “why” vs “nice-to-have” to prioritize business impact  
- See `/playbooks/plan-playbook.md`
</details>

<details>
<summary>🛠️ Build</summary>

- Drive dev timelines; tackle dependencies first; move nice-to-haves to backlog  
- Enforce coding standards, simplicity & maintainability (someone else should be able to pick it up)  
- Document code & PR context (e.g. “TE-1294: form-settings checkbox — looping twice was a quick fix”)  
- Track tech debt with `#TODO` tags and communicate slips/blockers early  
- See `/playbooks/build-playbook.md`
</details>

<details>
<summary>⚙️ Optimize</summary>

- Baseline & track performance metrics before/after changes  
- Refine build, env & integration processes for quality & velocity (efficiency, availability, testability)  
- Allocate dedicated sprint time for optimizations & tech-debt pay-down  
- Document and share improvements in `/playbooks/optimize-playbook.md`
</details>

<details>
<summary>📑 Document</summary>

- Use templates for clear writing (purpose, summary, content, conclusion, next steps)  
- Balance speed vs. clarity: docs in Confluence, GitHub, or slides—whatever gets read & adopted  
- Kick off discussions via presentations, code-review threads, research proposals  
- Track follow-up action items and adoption metrics  
- See `/playbooks/document-playbook.md`
</details>
