## Work-in-Progress Playbook for High-Impact Engineering Teams

> Building teams that ship, learn, and delight users.

I’ve led engineering efforts in scrappy two‑person startups and 200‑engineer orgs alike. Past wins include cutting cloud spend 80 %, doubling online revenue, and scaling product teams-but what matters here is the lightweight, adaptable system below that lets any team repeat those results **without sacrificing quality or customer impact.**

## Why First

Before we dive into process or code, we ask one question:

> **“What user problem or business outcome are we solving, and how will we know we nailed it?”**

Stating this North‑Star sentence up front keeps us out of bikeshed debates, aligns PM, design, and engineering on the value we’re delivering, and lets the whole team rally around a shared purpose. If we can’t finish the sentence, we pause, rethink, or pivot—saving countless cycles.

## Common Engineering Pitfalls & How We Avoid Them

| Pitfall                              | How We Tackle It                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Shiny‑object tech adoption**       | Run a cost‑benefit spike, capture an ADR, and tie adoption to a measurable business outcome (see *Research*).                                                               |
| **Scope creep & hidden work**        | Flag "3‑point" stories as red → unpack into spikes or split tickets before sprint start (see *Plan*).                                                                       |
| **Quality erosion & flaky releases** | Feature flags, robust e2e test suite, and peer reviews baked into our DoD (see *Build*).                                                                                    |
| **Design hand‑off gaps**             | Pre‑implementation walkthrough with PM, UX, QA, Lead Dev to clarify workflows & edge‑cases (see *Plan*).                                                                    |
| **End‑to‑end blind spots**           | Prioritise workflow‑level e2e tests over micro‑unit tests to protect real user journeys (see *Build*).                                                                      |
| **Last‑minute surprises**            | Red/Yellow/Green Slack check‑ins before stand‑up so we unblock yellows & reds fast (see *Accountability*).                                                                  |
| **Performance regressions**          | Define SLOs, instrument metrics, and hold **tech‑debt grooming sessions** to create tickets and lobby value during sprint planning-keeps reliability high (see *Optimize*). |
| **Invisible PR changes**             | Auto‑deploy PR preview environments so reviewers can click through features, not just read diffs (see *Build*).                                                             |
| **Risk‑blind code reviews**          | Tag each PR with Low/Med/High risk so the team can focus deep checks on high‑impact, cross‑over changes (see *Build*).                                                      |
| **Tribal knowledge loss**            | ADRs, diagrams, and quarterly doc‑sprints leave a clear artifact trail for future devs (see *Document*).                                                                    |

### Quick Practices You Can Adopt Today (Works for 3‑300 Devs)

*In addition to baseline Agile rituals—planning, daily stand‑ups, retros, and backlog refinement—these practices help teams level up fast.*

1. **Code/Feature Walkthroughs** - Short live demo + Q\&A for every significant feature before merge.

2. **Dev Group Sync (bi‑weekly)** - Rotating host, fill‑in agenda; showcase features, new tech, best practices, and capture next actions in shared minutes.

3. **Workflow‑focused E2E Tests** - Guard core user journeys; unit tests for edge‑case logic only.

4. **Design Walkthrough Meetings** - PM, UX, QA, Lead Dev explore wireframes together, documenting interactions and edge cases.

5. **Red‑Yellow‑Green Slack Check‑ins** - Post status 30 min before stand‑up so the meeting focuses on unblocking.

6. **PR Preview Deploys** - Auto‑spin a review environment; reviewers click through while reading the diff.

7. **PR Checklist via GitHub PR Templates** - Template requires author & reviewer to tick known gotchas before merge; list evolves with pattern analysis.

## Fast Ramp Onboarding Playbook

A repeatable, lightweight sequence that gets new engineers contributing value in their first week:

1. **Spin Up & First PR** - Follow dev‑environment docs to run the app locally and open a “hello world” pull request.
2. **Shadow Support** - Meet our internal support team for a walkthrough of how customers use the product and the common pain points they surface.
3. **Bug‑First Task** - Triage a low‑level error from our backlog, create a ticket, and ship the fix—hands‑on exposure to the codebase and deploy process.
4. **Doc Refresh** - Update any out‑of‑date steps you hit in the dev docs, leaving the path clearer for the next hire.

This cycle aligns new hires with real user problems, the production workflow, and our culture of continuous documentation.

## Accountability & Scorecard

> "We measure what we value—but each engineer owns the evidence."

Each pillar has a **living scorecard**—a handful of lightweight signals the team agrees truly indicate value (no vanity metrics). Examples might be spike lead‑time for **Research**, sprint‑goal hit‑rate for **Plan**, or bug kickback rate for **Build**. Every developer:

1. **Chooses one metric per pillar** they can influence.
2. **Surfaces evidence** (dashboard link, checklist screenshot, doc change) in the team's single source‑of‑truth dashboard (GitHub Projects, Jira, etc.).
3. **Reviews trends** in the bi‑weekly Dev Group Sync and proposes experiments when numbers drift.

The goal isn’t to game stats; it’s to keep a constant feedback loop that helps us level up together.
