## Accountability & Scorecard

> "We measure what we value—but each engineer owns the evidence."

Each pillar has a **living scorecard**—a handful of lightweight signals the team agrees truly indicate value (no vanity metrics). Examples might be spike lead‑time for **Research**, sprint‑goal hit‑rate for **Plan**, or bug kickback rate for **Build**. Every developer:

1. **Chooses one metric per pillar** they can influence.
2. **Surfaces evidence** (dashboard link, checklist screenshot, doc change) in the team's single source‑of‑truth dashboard (GitHub Projects, Jira, etc.).
3. **Reviews trends** in the bi‑weekly Dev Group Sync and proposes experiments when numbers drift.

The goal isn’t to game stats; it’s to keep a constant feedback loop that helps us level up together.
