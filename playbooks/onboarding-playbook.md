## Fast Ramp Onboarding Playbook

A repeatable, lightweight sequence that gets new engineers contributing value in their first week:

1. **Spin Up & First PR** - Follow dev‑environment docs to run the app locally and open a “hello world” pull request.
2. **Shadow Support** - Meet our internal support team for a walkthrough of how customers use the product and the common pain points they surface.
3. **Bug‑First Task** - Triage a low‑level error from our backlog, create a ticket, and ship the fix—hands‑on exposure to the codebase and deploy process.
4. **Doc Refresh** - Update any out‑of‑date steps you hit in the dev docs, leaving the path clearer for the next hire.

This cycle aligns new hires with real user problems, the production workflow, and our culture of continuous documentation.
