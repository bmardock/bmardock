# Playbooks

**Sharp, inspiring, and cynic-proof guides for teams who want to build amazing things together.**

## Why These Playbooks Exist

Most team "best practices" are either fluffy inspiration with no teeth, or rigid process that kills the energy that makes great teams great. These playbooks cut through both problems.

**They're sharp** - call out the real problems, avoid the obvious traps, and focus on what actually moves the needle.

**They're inspiring** - frame challenges as opportunities to level up, emphasize impact over process, and keep the garage energy alive as you scale.

**They're cynic-proof** - acknowledge real constraints, provide backup plans for when things break, and respect everyone's time.

## The Journey: Building Teams That Ship

### **Start with Purpose**
**[Vision & Roadmaps](./01-vision-roadmaps.md)** - Cut through feature requests to find the real customer problems worth solving. Turn vague ideas into compelling missions that energize the team.

### **Build Your Foundation** 
**[Operating System](./03-operating-system.md)** - Create the scaffolding that lets teams move fast without chaos. Five pillars that keep everything in balance as you grow.

**[Engineering Pitfalls & Fixes](./02-engineering-pitfalls.md)** - Spot the patterns that slow teams down and turn them into opportunities to level up your engineering practices.

### **Track What Matters**
**[Scorecard System](./04-scorecard-system.md)** - Name your trade-offs, track real progress, and keep everyone aligned on what winning actually looks like.

### **Grow Your Team**
**[Hiring](./05-hiring.md)** - Find people who are genuinely excited about your problems and can make everyone else better.

**[Onboarding](./08-onboarding.md)** - Get new teammates contributing in days, not weeks, while they experience your culture through action.

**[1:1 Coaching](./06-1-1-coaching.md)** - Develop people using the CAMPs framework. Keep belonging and growth alive as the team scales.

### **Execute with Energy**
**[Sprint Planning & Retros](./07-sprint-planning-retros.md)** - Turn planning meetings from homework into energizing sessions that build momentum and actually improve how you work.

## How to Use These

**Don't read them all at once.** Pick the one that addresses your current pain point.

**Bake into existing processes.** These are better ways to do what you're already doing. Sprint planning becomes more energizing. Hiring becomes more effective. 1:1s become more human.

**Seamless integration.** Rather than adding meetings or procedures, these playbooks improve your existing SDLC. Retros that actually change how you work. Code reviews that build team knowledge. Onboarding that happens during normal development flow.

**Start small and iterate.** Each playbook includes quick wins you can try immediately without disrupting everything.

**Focus on the insights, not the process.** The goal is building great teams, not following perfect procedures.

## The Garage Energy Philosophy

Great teams feel like a group of people in a garage who are genuinely excited to solve hard problems together. Everyone knows why the work matters, trusts each other to do their part, and feels energized by the progress they're making.

These playbooks help you keep that energy alive while building the systems you need to scale without losing what makes your team special.

**Remember:** Process should amplify your team's energy, not drain it. Rules should create freedom to focus on what matters, not bureaucracy that slows you down.
