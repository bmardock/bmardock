### 1) Kickoff (X minutes)

_Set the stage for productive work._

- **Align on outcome:** What does success look like?
- **Confirm participants:** Who needs to be here and what's their role?
- **Establish ground rules:** How will we make decisions and stay focused?

### 2) Core Work (X minutes)

_The main value-creating activity._

- **Generate options:** Explore alternatives and possibilities
- **Surface constraints:** What are we working within?
- **Gather perspectives:** Make sure all voices are heard

### 3) Pressure Test (X minutes)

_Make sure the solution will actually work._

- **Identify risks:** What could go wrong?
- **Challenge assumptions:** What are we taking for granted?
- **Consider edge cases:** How does this work in unusual situations?

### 4) Decide & Commit (X minutes)

_Turn discussion into action._

- **Make explicit trade-offs:** What are we choosing and why?
- **Assign clear ownership:** Who's responsible for what?
- **Set next checkpoint:** When and how will we check progress?

## Avoid These Traps (Common failure modes)

- **Status theater:** Meetings that feel productive but don't drive decisions
- **Hidden work:** Unowned tasks or risks that surface later
- **Perfectionism paralysis:** Waiting for perfect information instead of making progress
- **Committee decisions:** No clear owner means no real accountability
- **Process theater:** Following steps without focusing on outcomes

## Health Check (How to know this is working)

**Process effectiveness:**

- **Time to decision:** Are we making progress efficiently?
- **Participation quality:** Are the right people engaged and contributing?
- **Follow-through rate:** Do decisions actually get implemented?

**Outcome quality:**
