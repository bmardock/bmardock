# 08 â€” Onboarding Playbook

**When to pull this out**  
When someone new joins and you want them contributing meaningfully within days, not weeks. When you're ready to skip the corporate onboarding theater and focus on real productivity.

**Why it matters**  
Great onboarding turns nervous new hires into confident contributors who feel connected to customer impact from day one. Bad onboarding creates weeks of confusion, wasted mentor time, and impostor syndrome. The goal is getting someone productive and excited about the work, not checking boxes.

## The Essentials (Don't overthink it)

*Goal: Contributing in days, not weeks*

**Get them unstuck fast:**
- **Laptop + accounts that work** - if it's broken, fix it immediately or find a workaround
- **Code access + can deploy something** - even if it's just updating their name on the team page
- **Who to ask when stuck** - 1-2 people who will actually help, not "check the docs"

**Show them why it matters:**
- **Quick product demo** - 15 minutes showing what customers actually use
- **Recent customer pain** - real feedback/complaints so they understand what we're solving
- **How their work connects** such as "when you fix bugs here, customers stop complaining about X"

**Give them real work:**
- **Start with small bug fix** - something real but not mission-critical
- **Pair with someone** when they're stuck - don't let them struggle alone
- **Ship it when done** - see their code actually help customers

## What Actually Matters

**Speed up next time:**
- **Fix what broke during setup** - update the setup docs when you find gaps
- **Record explanations** - if you explained something twice, write it down
- **Keep docs current** - architecture overview, deployment process, coding standards
- **Automate the annoying stuff** - especially environment setup and access provisioning

**Keep it human:**
- **Check in daily first week** - are they stuck? confused? need anything?
- **Introduce them to people** - not just their team, but support, design, whoever
- **Grab lunch together** - they should feel welcomed, not isolated

## Avoid These Traps (Keep it human, not corporate)

- **Mandatory training videos:** Unless absolutely required - learn by doing instead
- **"Read docs for 3 days" onboarding:** Use docs as reference, not mandatory reading assignment  
- **Waiting for perfect setup:** Get them productive first, improve docs as you go
- **Process theater:** Focus on real contribution, not checking boxes

---

## Red Flags - Fix Immediately

- **Still can't run code locally after day 1** - drop everything and fix this
- **Hasn't shipped anything by end of week 1** - find them something they can actually complete
- **Sitting alone and confused** - someone needs to spend time with them

---

## Investment Priorities (If hiring regularly)

**High impact, low effort:**
- **Environment automation** - scripts, containers, whatever makes setup work consistently
- **Starter task list** - curated bugs/features perfect for new people
- **Basic product demo** - record it once, use for everyone

**Worth doing later:**
- Architecture overviews, detailed documentation, formal training

**Not worth it:**
- Complex onboarding workflows, mandatory e-learning, extensive checklists

*Remember: The goal is getting someone productive and excited about the work, not checking boxes. Keep it simple, human, and focused on real contribution.*
